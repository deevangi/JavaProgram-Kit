. Implicit Wait vs. Explicit Wait
The implicit and explicit wait is used to wait for an element to appear on the page. However, there are some differences between them:

Timeouts: Implicit wait sets a default timeout for the entire test runtime, while explicit wait sets timeouts for specific conditions.
Condition: Implicit wait waits for an element to appear on the page, while explicit wait waits for a specific condition, such as the presence of an element or the element to be clickable.
Scope: Implicit wait applies globally, while explicit wait applies locally to a specific element.
Exception: Implicit wait throws a NoSuchElementException when the WebDriver cannot find the element within the specified timeout. In contrast, explicit wait throws a TimeoutException when the element doesnâ€™t meet the condition within the specified timeout.
The implicit wait is helpful when we want to wait a certain amount of time for elements to appear on the page. However, the explicit wait is the better option if we need to wait for a specific condition.
